    <meta name="twitter:description" content=" Austin and Joshua are obsessed with their super hot stepmom, Danae. All they want to do is impress her, so they’re constantly fighting for her attention. Things get competitive between the boys, especially when playing with their stepmom’s tits and pussy is at stake. Danae knows her effect on the guys, and she always plays it up. She knows she shouldn’t fuck around with her stepsons, but she can’t help but dream about their cocks and wonder just how horny they are for her. Instead of pitting Austin and Joshua against each other and choosing one over the other, she decides it would be way more fun to play with them both. After all, two cocks are better than one, and the more Danae gets to suck and fuck, the happier she is. Still, Austin and Joshua can’t help but keep their competitive spirits high, wanting to be the one to make their stepmom cum. The guys fuck Danae hard until they’re both busting big creamy loads for her..
